It tells our visualization that Eukarya already exists somewhere else on this tree and that Archaea is an additional parent. We have to do this, because otherwise the program gets super grumpy about us violating a normal tree structure. Also, it keeps us from having to repeat ourselves by listing out Eukarya and all of its children twice."
